    <h3>Africa</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Lucida Sans Regular; color:rebeccapurple; background: #5555553b">
    Africa is the second–largest continent after Asia. It also has the second–largest population after Asia. About one billion people live in Africa. That is almost 15% of the world’s population. There are currently 54 countries on the continent of Africa, when including island countries and the Western Sahara. The number of countries sometimes changes because many of the countries were made by colonial powers. Colonial powers are countries that made colonies in Africa when it was first being discovered by outsiders. There are about 2,000 different languages in Africa. Most of the languages belong to one of four large language groups. The four large language groups are Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo, and the Khoisan languages. People also speak some non–African languages in Africa. About 20% of the population speak Arabic, mostly in northern Africa. About 10% speak Swahili, mostly in south-eastern Africa. About 5% speak Hausa, mostly in western Africa. Many people also speak English, French, and Portuguese. One African country, Nigeria, has 250 different languages! There are many different tribes and cultures in Africa. For example, there is the Ashanti people. They live in Ghana. They are famous for their beautiful Kente cloth. Kente cloth can be different colors. Ashanti people wear clothing made of Kente cloth for important events. There are also the Madinka people. They live in West Africa mostly in Senegal, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau. Some Madinka people also live in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Cote d'Ivoire. The Madinka people are famous for their music. They tell their history with music. Most scientists think that the first humans came from Africa. The first written information in Africa comes from Egypt at around 3300 B.C.E. (B.C.E. means Before the Common Era., or before the year “0”). Egypt is one of the oldest African civilizations. At that time, Egypt traded with Phoenicia, which is now Lebanon, and includes parts of Israel, Palestine, and Syria. Egypt was discovered by the ancient Greeks, who were the first Europeans to go to Africa.</p>

    <h3>Fingerprint</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Georgia; color:rgba(51, 153, 51, 0.418); background: #e2c026d3">
      If you enjoy watching crime shows on TV, you know that fingerprints play a large role in identifying people. But, you might be surprised to find out that using fingerprints for identification is not a new science. In fact, it is very old –– dating back at least as far as 1885-1913 B.C.E. In Babylon, when people agreed to a business contract, they pressed their fingerprints into the clay in which the contract was written. Thumbprints have also been found on clay seals from ancient China.
      In 14th century Persia, which is now Iran, a government doctor recognized that all fingerprints are different. In 1684, a British doctor, Nehemiah Grew, spoke about the ridged surfaces of the fingers. In 1686, a professor of anatomy (the study of the structure of the human body) named Marcello Malpighi, wrote about the ridges and loops in fingerprints. Malpighi’s work was considered so important that a layer of skin found on the fingertips was named after him. This layer of skin is called the Malpighian layer. Although scientists had studied fingerprints, the value of fingerprinting in the identification of individuals did not become clear until later.
      Sir William James Herschel is generally thought to be the first European to realize that fingerprints were unique to each person. In his work as chief magistrate in the Hoogly district in Jungipoor, India, Herschel asked people to put their handprints on contracts. Herschel believed that personal contact with the contracts made people more likely to honor their commitments, or to keep their promises. As he looked at more and more handprints, he began to see that all the handprints were different. He started to believe that fingerprints were unique, which means they are all different from each other, and permanent, which means that they do not ever change. To prove that they never change, Herschel kept track of his own fingerprints over his entire lifetime.
      Dr. Henry Faulds, a British surgeon at a Japanese hospital, began studying the furrows (also called ridges) on fingertips in the 1870s. He published an article in a scientific journal about the use of fingerprints as a tool in identification. He also devised, or invented, a system of classifying fingerprints. He wrote Charles Darwin about his findings, but Darwin was getting too old to work on the findings. So, he promised to pass the information to his cousin, Sir Francis Galton. Using Henry Faulds’s findings, Galton published a major book on classifying fingerprints based on arches, loops, and whorls. His work with Sir Edward R. Henry on fingerprint classification was the basis of a classification system which is still used by law enforcement agencies in English–speaking countries.

    <h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
    <p style="font-family:cambria; color:rgba(8, 8, 49, 0.418); background: #660a4fd3">
      Slap! Swat! How do those annoying mosquitoes find you? Is it your wonderful personality or is it something else which attracts them? And why are you so rarely able to swat them before they fly off to another feast?
      There are about 3,500 species of mosquitoes in the world. Not all of them are in your back yard, although sometimes it seems that the summer evening air is filled with them. There are about 200 species of mosquitoes in the United States –– about 80 species have been identified in Florida, which is an ideal breeding area. The word “mosquito” means “little fly” in Portuguese. Mosquitoes are members of the scientific order Diptera, the “True Flies.” Like other “True Flies,” they have wings. But they are different from some True Flies; their wings have scales. These tiny scales help eliminate the effects of friction. This helps the mosquitoes skim quickly and efficiently through the air, making them almost impossible to swat. The familiar high–pitched, annoying buzz of the mosquito comes from the sound of its wings beating 600 times per second!
      If you want to control the spread of these pesky insects, it is important to know how they live and breed. As you will see, much of their life is spent in water, so getting rid of standing water plays a large role in controlling mosquitoes. There are four stages in the lifetime of a mosquito: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.
      Mosquito eggs need water to hatch. Different species of mosquitoes prefer different places to lay their eggs. Some prefer to lay their eggs in standing water, such as water in old tires or buckets. Others like to lay their eggs in areas with a lot of organic material, like leaves and grass, so they lay their eggs in marshes and swamps. Some prefer fresh water; some like saltwater.
      Mosquito larvae are called “wigglers” because they move with jerking movements of their bodies. They spend most of their time under the surface of the water, feeding on leaves and grass. They must have air to stay alive, so they wiggle to the surface. The larvae shed their skin four times as they grow and progress to the third stage, which is the pupa.
      Mosquito pupae also need air to stay alive. They continue to feed on grasses and leaves under the surface of the water, but they must come up for air. After several days in the pupa stage, the pupae mature into adult mosquitoes.
      Adult mosquitoes emerge after several days of growth. Some mosquitoes reach maturity in as few as 5 days, but most require 10–14 days before they reach maturity. Variations in maturity time is due to differences in species and differences in the temperature of the environment. Adult mosquitoes mate within a few days of their emergence as adults. They eat fruit, nectar, and any other sources of sugar they can find. Female mosquitoes need blood in order for their eggs to develop. After the female has her meal of blood, she rests for two or three days before she lays her eggs. The cycle of eating and laying eggs continues for one or two weeks, which is the lifetime of a mosquito.
      Now you know that it is the female mosquitoes which bite you. But how do they find you their meal of blood? Mosquitoes seek out warmth and movement both properties of human beings and other animals. They also seek carbon dioxide, which is exhaled by humans and other animals. So while it is not exactly your wonderful personality which attracts them, the social activities of conversation and laughter which involve movement and the exhalation of carbon dioxide are what attract these annoying little insects!Mosquitoes

    <h3>Sleep</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Times; color:rgba(8, 8, 49, 0.418); background: #ece91ad3">
      “Wake up!” Do you hear these words often? If so, maybe you are not getting enough sleep. What is sleep? Why do people sleep? How much sleep do you need? All people sleep. All mammals and birds also sleep. Some reptiles, amphibians, and fish sleep too. Scientists understand some of the reasons for sleep. But they do not understand everything about it.
      There are two kinds of sleep in mammals and birds. One kind of sleep is Rapid Eye Movement sleep, which we call REM sleep. The other kind of sleep is Non–Rapid Eye Movement sleep, which we call NREM or non–REM sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine divides NREM sleep into three sttages: N1, N2, and N3 sleep.
      When people first go to sleep, they are in NREM sleep. The first stage of NREM sleep is N1 sleep. During N1 sleep, people get very drowsy. Some people have muscle twitches during this part of sleep. People are not very conscious of, or aware of, their surroundings during this stage of sleep. Brain monitors identify small, slow, and irregular brain waves during N1 sleep. The second stage of sleep is N2 sleep. People are not at all conscious of their surroundings during N2 sleep. About 45%-55% of total adult sleep is N2 sleep. Brain monitors identify large brain waves with quick bursts of activity during N2 sleep. The third stage of sleep is N3 sleep. It is very deep sleep. Brain monitors identify very slow brain waves during N3 sleep. Therefore, N3 sleep is called slow–wave sleep (SWS.) After N3 sleep, people cycle back to lighter N2 sleep before going into REM sleep. People cycle Through the stages of NREM sleep 4 or 5 times each night and enter REM sleep several times during one night.
      Dreams occur during REM sleep and the eyes move quickly beneath closed eyelids. During REM sleep, people and animals are paralyzed. Scientists think people enter a state in which they cannot move so they will not hurt themselves while they are dreaming.
      The National Sleep Foundation in the United States says that 7–9 hours of sleep daily is best for an adult. Seven to nine hours of sleep is good for memory, alertness, problem–solving, and health. Less than six hours of sleep affects the ability to think. Getting too much sleep may not be good for people either. Too much sleep is linked to sickness and depression.
      Babies need a lot more sleep than adults. A new born infant needs up to 18 hours of sleep each day. A baby spends about nine hours in REM sleep. Five–year–olds need 11–13 hours of sleep each day. A five–year old spends about 2 hours in REM sleep. Teenagers need 9–10 hours of sleep each day. Pregnant women need more sleep than other adults. Many people think that elderly people need less sleep than younger adults, but that is not true. Most adults do well with 7–9 hours of sleep. Scientists are not sure of all the reasons for sleep. They know that sleep helps the body heal and grow. Sleep helps the immune system – which helps people fight disease. Sleep helps the infant brain grow. It seems that REM sleep is especially important for babies’ brain growth. It also seems that sleep is a time for processing memories. 
      Why do we dream? Some scientists believe that dreams have a psychological purpose. Some think that dreams help organize our brains. Some think that dreams are the result of random brain activity during REM sleep. Sleep patterns differ substantially from culture to culture. Cultures with artificial light have different sleep patterns from cultures without artificial light (like electric lamps.) In cultures that use artificial light, people usually go to sleep later at night, and they sleep through the night. In other cultures, people often sleep for two periods. They go to sleep shortly after the sun goes down. They sleep deeply for several hours. Then, they tend to wake up for several hours. Afterward, they go to sleep again for several more hours. In hunter gatherer groups, people sleep off and on throughout the day and night. People sleep in a variety of places, too. Some people sleep on the ground. Some sleep on mats or in beds. Some use pillows, blankets, and other bedding. But they all sleep!
      Good night! Sweet dreams!
